              <p>One of the many reasons why people like playing video games is because when they make progress, the game rewards them is some way. Our team wants to apply the "Video Game Reward System" to cooking. We will apply it to cooking by 'Leveling Up' by getting more 'EXP' (experience points) every time they successfully finish a recipe at their level. As they continue to gain experience cooking, they will be able to 'level up' their cooking. We believe that if you continually use our website, that you will get better at cooking.</p>
